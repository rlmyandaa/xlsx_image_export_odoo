## Limitation

- Currently .webp image is not supported, so in the exported file it will become raw base64 value.
- Due to xlsxwriter x_scale and y_scale often output strange result in the final excel file, image will be resized first so that there will be no scaling config used when using xlsxwriter.
- The downside is that due to the image are being resized, there might be some quality loss especially if user tries to upscale the image in the final excel file.
